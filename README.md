# Client predicate tryout

Trying to understand how to work with predicates. 
Predicate code in the backend, currently it's the simplest predicate possible as taken from https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/master/sway-program-types/predicates.html. 

Steps in frontend:
1. connect to testnet
2. setup predicate
3. fund predicate address through test wallet
4. spend funds from predicate <- FAILS.. don't know why
